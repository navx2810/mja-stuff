Grab the database structure for Content and Content Block objects.
Everything is assigned to one Content (meaning the landing page or something)

Video ->
    Name : cbHeadline
    URL : cbLink
    Image : cbPhoto

Blurb ->
    cbCopy : Text Input

Maybe for organization, there will be three pieces of content: One for Videos, one for blurbs, one for ad carousel.
